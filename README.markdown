# NYC GOV Data #

See [Big Apps]:http://www.nycbigapps.com/ and [NYC Data]:http://nyc.gov/data

After trying to explore the various datasets online I wanted to just have one list of all datasets.

This is a Rhino based javascript which will parse the available datasets and dump them to a text file and a json file.  See /data for these files.

Those maybe of interest to you.

## Usage ##

Requires that [Rhino]:http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/ be installed



  `java org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main -f parse_data.js`
